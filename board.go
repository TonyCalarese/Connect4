// board.go for CSI 380 Assignment 3
// This file contains types and an interface for maintaining the state of a game.
// They are generic enough to work for several games, but specifically will work for Connect 4.
// You can implement this Assignment without making any changes to this file.

// Represents the key to a transition from one position
// to another position
// In Connect 4 this is which column is selected
// to drop a piece
type Move uint

// Represents a player's piece and also turns.
